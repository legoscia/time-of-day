* time-of-day-mode

=time-of-day-mode= is a global minor mode that displays an image
representing the time of day in the mode line.  During the "day",
it displays the sun going from sunrise to sunset, and during the
"night", it displays the moon moving across the sky.

"Day" and "night" refer to the times set in =time-of-day-dawn= and
=time-of-day-dusk=.  By default, "day" lasts from 9 AM to 6 PM, which
is meant to show a working day.

This mode attempts to show the image only once in each frame, in
the right-most bottom-most window.

=tod-schedule-24hrs.png= was taken from [[http://wesnoth.org/][Battle for Wesnoth]], and is
licenced under GPLv2 or later.

And this is how it behaves during an entire day, using the default
settings:

** Installation
Keep =time-of-day.el= and =tod-schedule-24hrs.png= in the same
directory.  Byte-compile and load =time-of-day.el=.  Then type =M-x
time-of-day-mode= to toggle.

** Known problems
On Emacs 24.4.50 running on OSX, using this mode seems to trigger an
infinite loop in =redisplay_internal= at irregular intervals.  I
haven't found a reproducible recipe.  If you're running Emacs inside
=gdb=, this can be worked around by following these steps:

1. Hit =C-z= in the =gdb= window, to stop Emacs and get to the
   debugger command line.
2. Type =bt= to display a backtrace.
3. Identify the outermost stack frame for =redisplay_windows=, just
   before =redisplay_internal=.  In the following example, we need
   frame 25:
   #+begin_example
   #23 0x00000001001f37f7 in internal_condition_case_1 (bfun=0x1000849d0 <redisplay_window_0>, arg=5469649813, handlers=4345323126, hfun=0x100071b00 <redisplay_window_error>) at ../../src/eval.c:1373
   #24 0x0000000100071a33 in redisplay_windows (window=5469649813) at ../../src/xdisp.c:14227
   #25 0x00000001000719e2 in redisplay_windows (window=5455279213) at ../../src/xdisp.c:14221
   #26 0x000000010003db16 in redisplay_internal () at ../../src/xdisp.c:13826
   #+end_example
4. Type =f= and the frame number.  In the case above, this would be =f
   25=.
5. Type =fin=, to run until =redisplay_windows= returns.  This should
   print something like:
   #+begin_example
   (gdb) fin
   Run till exit from #25 0x00000001000719e2 in redisplay_windows (window=5455279213) at ../../src/xdisp.c:14221
   0x000000010003db16 in redisplay_internal () at ../../src/xdisp.c:13826
   13826                        redisplay_windows (FRAME_ROOT_WINDOW (f));
   #+end_example
6. Type =p f->fonts_changed = 0=.
7. Type =c=.

Sometimes the procedure above needs to be repeated two or three
times.
