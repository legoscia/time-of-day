* time-of-day-mode

=time-of-day-mode= is a global minor mode that displays an image
representing the time of day in the mode line.  During the "day",
it displays the sun going from sunrise to sunset, and during the
"night", it displays the moon moving across the sky.

"Day" and "night" refer to the times set in =time-of-day-dawn= and
=time-of-day-dusk=.  By default, "day" lasts from 9 AM to 6 PM, which
is meant to show a working day.

This mode attempts to show the image only once in each frame, in
the right-most bottom-most window.
